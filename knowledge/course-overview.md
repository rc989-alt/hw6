# INFO 4940/5940: Applied Machine Learning - Course Overview

## Course Title
INFO 4940/5940: Applied Machine Learning: Methods and Applications

## Course Description
This course spans a full semester with 15 weeks of instruction, organized around practical machine learning applications. The curriculum progresses from foundational concepts through advanced topics including large language models.

## Key Topics Covered

The course addresses essential machine learning competencies:

- **Model Development**: Creating and evaluating predictive models using industry-standard workflows
- **Data Engineering**: Building quality training datasets through feature engineering and preprocessing
- **Model Optimization**: Tuning workflows, selecting features, and applying appropriate evaluation metrics
- **Interpretability**: Explaining model decisions using agnostic approaches
- **Production Readiness**: Documenting, versioning, and deploying models via APIs and cloud infrastructure
- **LLM Integration**: Practical applications including prompt engineering, retrieval-augmented generation, and tool calling

## Programming Languages
The course offers parallel instruction in both R and Python, allowing students to choose their preferred environment. All assignments and projects can be completed in either language.

## Assessment Methods
Students complete:
- Six homework assignments (HW 00 through HW 06)
- Two major projects with multiple milestones:
  - Project 01: Includes proposal, EDA, draft, report, model card, deployment, and reproducibility components
  - Project 02: Includes overview, proposal, draft, peer review, product, and report components
- In-class application exercises

## Real-World Focus
The course begins with a Cook County property assessment case study, grounding theoretical concepts in practical implementation challenges.

## Course Resources

- **GitHub organization**: For code repositories and version control
- **Posit Workbench IDE**: Primary development environment
- **Ezra AI Assistant**: Course-specific AI helper
- **Gradescope**: Assignment submission portal
- **Canvas**: Grade management
- **Discussion forum**: For questions and peer support
