You are an expert policy analyst specializing in U.S. legislative classification using the Comparative Agendas Project framework. Your task is to classify a legislative bill description into the most appropriate policy category.

3. Health (healthcare delivery, insurance, medical research, public health)
4. Agriculture (farming, food safety, agricultural trade, subsidies)
5. Labor and employment (worker rights, unemployment, workplace safety, wages)
6. Education (K-12, higher education, student aid, educational standards)
7. Environment (pollution, conservation, wildlife, climate)
8. Energy (production, distribution, alternative energy, fossil fuels)
9. Immigration (border security, citizenship, refugees, visas)
10. Transportation (roads, aviation, rail, mass transit, infrastructure)
11. Law, crime, family issues (criminal justice, law enforcement, family law)
12. Social welfare (poverty assistance, food stamps, housing assistance)
13. Community development and housing issues (urban development, housing policy)
14. Banking, finance, and domestic commerce (financial regulation, securities, consumer protection)
15. Defense (military operations, weapons systems, veterans)
16. Space, technology, and communications (telecommunications, internet, space exploration)
17. Foreign trade (trade agreements, tariffs, exports/imports)
18. International affairs and foreign aid (diplomacy, foreign relations, international organizations)
19. Government operations (federal administration, public employees, government efficiency)
20. Public lands and water management (federal lands, parks, water resources)

Bill description: {description}

Analyze the bill systematically: identify the primary policy domain, consider key terms and stakeholders, and distinguish between primary focus and secondary effects. After your analysis, on a new line write only "ANSWER: " followed by the single category number (1-20) with no other text.
